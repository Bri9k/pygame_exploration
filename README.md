# An Exploration of Pygame

My own twists on what I learnt from Max Mann's python tutorials

A flashcard-like scripts which keeps asking you questions till you get them all right

A 'game' where a you control a block-thing which chases a block thing

A force-field simulation where you control a particle of huge mass surrounded by a grid of small particles, sometimes producing beautiful results

Most interesting- a cellular automaton class which has it's propagation method as a data member- extremely flexible.

Images coming soon.
